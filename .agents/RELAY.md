# Cross-Agent Relay State

## Status: IN PROGRESS (Drafting/Planning)

**Branch:** `feature/plan-c-graph-quality`
**Target Plan:** `.agents/plans/C_graph_quality.md`

## Goal
Implement Batch 2: Plan C (Graph Quality) to stabilize the graph layer, establish community reports, and synthesize insights. The previous milestone (Plan B) has been successfully merged and shipped.

## Progress Status
- Workspace prepared: `master` pulled, `feature/plan-c-graph-quality` branched
  (sits exactly at merged-B `master` `bcfb36a`; no own commits before P0).
- **P0 COMPLETE** (2026-06-14, Claude): coding-time Evidence Ledger
  `.agents/plans/C_roadmap_evidence.md` written. Captured rollback anchor
  (SHA, schema v8→9 plan, versions, active scenario `gaussian_splatting`,
  authoritative generations GEN-bc1dc52a/GEN-57bd7593). DB backed up
  (`state.sqlite.C-baseline.bak`, integrity ok, restore parity verified).
  Read-only graph baseline audit recorded; concerns reproduced/scheduled
  (live unsupported-relation `REL-b6d5b9fc`; GQ07 confidence-calibration
  scheduled for P2/P4). Multi-metric hierarchy benchmark contract frozen.
  No behavior change.

## Immediate Next Action
- **P1 schema gate APPROVED** (2026-06-14, Claude): user approved the locked
  `SCHEMA.md` §21 design (`SCHEMA_VERSION 8→9`, target v0.9.0) at the plan's
  mandatory schema gate. Committed `ded3886`.
- **P1 (docs-first contracts) COMPLETE** (2026-06-14, Claude). All P1
  deliverables written, committed, no code / no behavior change:
  - `SCHEMA.md` §21 + §11 version-history narrative (`ded3886`, `e3f33ef`).
  - `SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR.md` §27 (resolution/support/lifecycle/hierarchy/reports/
    graph-audit/migration/reconciliation/GQ07/testbed) + `SEARCH_ENGINE_SCHEMA`
    §11 (graph-quality materialization) + `PLUGIN_SCHEMA` title→v0.9.0, "no
    plugin contract change" note (`c419c66`).
  - EN→KR guides: `WORKFLOW_GUIDE(_KR)` §11, `USER_GUIDE(_KR)` Graph Quality
    section (`cca6d63`).
  - Three core spec domains synced to v0.9.0 in their titles.
- **⛔ STOPPED AT MANDATORY GATE (before P2 application code).** Per plan
  "Mandatory Stop" / Stop Conditions: stop before any application code until P1
  contracts are approved. The schema design is approved and the full P1 contract
  set is now frozen. **Next phase = P2** (failing resolution/relation/hierarchy
  gold tests — adversarial fixtures, graph-audit tests, frozen hierarchy
  benchmark fixtures). P2 is TDD test-writing (still pre-implementation per plan)
  but is the start of the code-bearing phases; awaiting user go-ahead to begin
  P2 before writing any tests/code.
