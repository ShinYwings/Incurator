## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Cross-device Knowledge Sync Bridge** (`wiki db export / wiki db import`)
  - Export the knowledge DB to a portable JSONL file (`wiki db export`)
  - Import a JSONL file into another device's DB with Last-Write-Wins merge (`wiki db import`)
  - `--dry-run` option to preview changes before writing
  - `--compress` option for gzip output (`.jsonl.gz`)
  - `--since <datetime>` for incremental (delta) exports
  - Post-import automatic `wiki reindex` (skippable with `--skip-reindex`)
  - Device-local tables (embeddings, job state, FTS5 indices) are automatically excluded from exports
- **Tombstone table** (`deleted_records`) — deleted records propagate to other devices on next import
- `db_sync.record_tombstone()` helper for future delete operations to call
- **Syncthing auto-sync (Zotero-grade, one-writer-per-file)** (`wiki db autosync`)
  - Each device writes only its own `.curator/sync/dev-<id>.jsonl` snapshot and imports
    every peer's — no Syncthing write-write conflicts by construction
  - Row-level Last-Write-Wins + tombstones: concurrent offline edits on two devices both
    survive (no whole-file overwrite)
  - Structural loop prevention with **no content-hash guard**: own file never imported,
    re-export only when the local DB actually changed
  - Syncthing `*.sync-conflict-*` files imported as LWW peers, then archived under
    `.curator/runtime/sync_conflicts/`
  - Reference-Mode `sources.external_path` preserved per device on merge
    (`_DEVICE_LOCAL_COLUMNS`)
  - Device-local `.curator/sync_state.json` (excluded via `.stignore`) tracks device id +
    per-peer high-water marks
  - Obsidian plugin: on-load sync, `.curator/sync` file watcher (desktop) + 60s poll
    fallback, manual "Sync Knowledge DB" ribbon, status-bar indicator, four default-on
    settings toggles
  - Optional `auto_sync.enabled` so CLI `wiki update` exports this device's snapshot

### Changed

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped from 6 → 7 (non-destructive; adds `deleted_records` table only)
- Existing vaults self-heal on next `wiki` invocation

### Fixed

- `wiki db import` reported `0 changes` after any prior export — caused by a
  `sync_meta.json` content-hash loop guard, now removed in favor of structural
  loop prevention (dry-run and real import report/apply the identical delta)

### Documentation

- `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` + `USER_GUIDE_KR.md`: "Cross-Device Knowledge Sync" +
  `wiki db autosync` section
- `docs/guides/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md` + `_KR.md`: plugin auto-sync settings/triggers
- `docs/guides/SYNC_IGNORE_GUIDE.md` + `_KR.md`: `sync_state.json` exclusion;
  keep `.curator/sync/` synced
- `docs/specs/system_behavior/SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR.md`: §13.1 one-writer-per-file auto-sync;
  §13.3 device-local sync state
- `docs/specs/curator_schema/SCHEMA.md`: §11.17 `deleted_records` contract +
  `_DEVICE_LOCAL_COLUMNS`
